  Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects.
  Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get the
  ball rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.

## Troptrap's Developer Playground
**Welcome to the wonderful (and sometimes confusing) world of coding!**
I'm Troptrap, and like many aspiring backend developers, I'm on a journey to conquer the complexities of the web. While I'm decent in Python, JavaScript, my adventures with CSS  and HTML are...well, let's just say they involve more glitter cannons than grids (yet). 
**Here's what you'll find in my corner of the internet:**
* **Backend Projects:** Explore with me Python bots, JavaScript applications, and anything else that makes the magic happen behind the scenes.
* **Work in Progress:**  This section is a treasure trove of ongoing projects. Witness the glorious chaos of a developer wrestling with CSS frameworks (and hopefully emerging victorious). Feel free to join the journey and provide moral support (or CSS tips)!
* **Learning Resources:**  Ever get stuck on a coding conundrum? Sharing is caring, so I'll be adding helpful articles, tutorials, and anything else that's helped me navigate the coding wilderness.
**Why GitHub Pages?**
This is my playground to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer.  Consider it a digital laboratory where I can tinker, test, and unleash my creativity (without accidentally breaking anything critical...hopefully).
**Stay tuned!**
As I continue to learn and explore, this website will evolve alongside my coding skills.  So, swing by again soon to see what new projects and adventures await!
